The raw unstrctured big data is considered for this repo. The dataset is a webpage
produced from automotive testing. The resulted webpage constitutes
series of HTML and XML contents and are humongous.
The XML and HTML contents are initially parsed in the data pre- processing
stage as shown in Testfall.py, Teschritte.py, Inhalt.py. The parsed data is then stored in the database.
The data extracted from the database is in a transformed structured format as
shown in Database file. This data is then loaded into a data frame. The above
process is considered ETL. The resulted structured data is efficient and is
also made more human-readable. Statistical analysis specifically descriptive analysis is then performed on
the structured data shown in . Additionally, the error patterns,
total error counts, and repeated testing statistics are made with the help of
data visualization using matplotlib histograms as shown in matplotlib file.
